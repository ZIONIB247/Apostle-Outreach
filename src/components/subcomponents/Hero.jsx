              Today's unsustainable cost of living is forcing more youth into
              homelessness â€“ at a time when fewer beds are available. This makes
              the care Covenant House provides more important than ever, and we
              need your help right now to keep our doors open 24/7.
            </p> <br />

            <p>
              Your generosity will provide them with a wide range of
              opportunities to break the cycle of homelessness permanently.
              Please give today and help homeless youth access the care and
              services they urgently need.
